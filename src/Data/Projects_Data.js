        "about": "A 6-Dimensional terrain simulation using a wave function collapse algorithm to design the terrain in Python using Panda3D. Each piece is within a 3x3x3 space. The wave function collapses all the possible pieces one by one until the board is filled or it cannot find a piece to fit.",
        "learnt": "This was a very fun project where I had to push my mental capacity quiet a bit. Although, I'd like to do a lot more to it, I think I'm happy with it's current state. It's works and well!",

        "about": "I developed a Python application with a simulation to test Tkinter's performance when directly modifying the pixels every frame, like I've done in Java. Depending on the results, I wanted to do much more to this, unfortunately, the results weren't that good and it was really slow. I looked into Cython to maybe doing some fast number crunching but ended up going down a rabbit hole.",
        "learnt": "I was able to learn a cool algorithm in the development of this simulation and pressed the boundaries of Python's abilities. This project gave me a deeper undestanding of the limits of Python in comparison to other languages, especially lower-level languages.",
